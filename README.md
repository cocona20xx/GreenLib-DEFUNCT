# GreenLib
GreenLib is a basic Library mod that will be utilized in my other mods after PHASE 1 begins. As of PHASE 0, it is a test mod.

# Phases
Progress for this mod is mainly going to be planned out in two phases, PHASE 0 and PHASE 1.
PHASE 0 is mostly testing, while PHASE 1 is when non-test stuff begins to be created. When this happens, a major code restructure will occur.
